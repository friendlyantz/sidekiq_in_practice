# Professor Gray's Satellite Data Processing

One last thing before you go, minion - I mean, valued member of my team:

I'm having a problem with one particular analysis job. It uses so much memory that we keep going into swap because of it. Can you fix the memory issues but keep the performance nice and zippy?

Your requirements:

1. The completion hash logged at the end of the application must be: 82184f277f6f7699d9b1ff8582d89c8a
2. The application must execute in 7 seconds or less.

# Professor Gray's Satellite Data Processing

Greetings:

I tried to do some fancy things with this new job I'm working on, but it keeps crashing! Can you please fix it?

Your requirements:

1. The application must execute in 30 seconds or less.
2. You may only use 1 Sidekiq server process, and you may not change the concurrency.
